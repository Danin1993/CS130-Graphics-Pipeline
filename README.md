# CS130 Rendering Pipeline Project
A project in which the rendering pipeline method is used to render objects
to the screen.

## Features
Rasterize multiple triangles. Currently triangles can only be rendered plain
and white. No perspective has been implemented yet.

## Requirements
SCons is required to build this project.

## Disclamer
This code was given to us by [Professor Tamar Shinar](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~shinar/). 
I do not claim to own this code; I merely modified parts of it for the lab.
